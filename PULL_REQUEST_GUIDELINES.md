# Pull Request Guidelines

Thank you for your contribution! To ensure that your pull request is reviewed and merged smoothly, please follow these guidelines.

## General Guidelines

1. **Title & Description**:
   - Provide a clear and descriptive title for your pull request.
   - Include a brief summary of the changes in the description.
   - If the PR fixes an issue, reference it using `Fixes #issue_number`.

2. **Scope**:
   - Keep your pull request focused on a single issue or feature. Avoid combining multiple changes into one PR.
   - If your PR contains multiple commits, ensure each commit is meaningful and serves a distinct purpose.

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Ensure that your code follows the project's coding standards and best practices.
   - Run all tests to make sure your changes don't break existing functionality.
   - If applicable, write new tests to cover the changes you've made.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update documentation to reflect any changes to public APIs, new features, or changes in functionality.
   - If your PR introduces a new feature, include relevant examples or usage instructions.

5. **Review Process**:
   - Once your pull request is submitted, it will be reviewed by a project maintainer.
   - Address any feedback promptly and push updates to your PR.
   - Be responsive to comments and questions from reviewers.

## Branching & Merging

1. **Branching**:
   - Create your branch from the develop branch, not from the master or any other branch.
   - Name your branch based on the issue or feature you're working on, e.g., `fix/issue-123`, `feature/new-component`.

2. **Merging**:
   - Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the develop branch before submitting your pull request.
   - Use a rebase or merge strategy that maintains a clean commit history.

3. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - If your branch has merge conflicts with the base branch, resolve them locally before pushing your changes.

## Additional Notes

- **Review Time**: Allow some time for maintainers to review your pull request. Larger or more complex changes may take longer to review.
- **Code Ownership**: Ensure that your contribution does not introduce or alter existing code ownership or licensing agreements.

By following these guidelines, you'll help us maintain a high standard of code quality and ensure that your contributions can be integrated smoothly into the project. Thank you for helping make this project better!
